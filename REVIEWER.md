As a NeuroLibre reviewer, you are responsible for the technical quality of the resources available for the community. Currently, Neurolibre welcome submissions along two tracks of neuroscience-related material: (1) tutorials, (2) paper companions. If you have been invited for review, it means that an Editor has already established that the submission qualifies in principles, and an administrator has been able to make the resource available for the neurolibre binder. But it doses not mean the resource is ready for final publication, and takes full advantage of the notebook format. The archetype of a high quality submission depends on the submission track. 

For tutorials, an example of high quality resource would be the scikit-learn tutorials, for example this one on [cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html). 

Submissions undergo a technical review. As a 

The NeuroLibre team checks that the notebooks fit one of the two tracks above, run correctly, and that the text and code are readable. We also check how much compute time and data storage are required. NeuroLibre commits to provide computational resources for free, yet this investment must benefit substantially the Open NeuroScience community. The Neurolibre team reserves the right of rejecting a submission if the content of the notebook is judged to fall outside Neuroscience, requires excessive resources for the proposed scope of work, or if the code or text is of unsufficient quality. Note that NeuroLibre purely reviews the technical aspects of the notebooks, and not the scientific content. As such, a NeuroLibre review complements, rather than replaces, the reviews offered by traditional scientific journals.
